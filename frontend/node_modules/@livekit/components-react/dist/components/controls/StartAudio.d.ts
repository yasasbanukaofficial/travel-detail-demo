 * The `StartAudio` component is only visible when the browser blocks audio playback. This is due to some browser implemented autoplay policies.
 * To start audio playback, the user must perform a user-initiated event such as clicking this button.
 * As soon as audio playback starts, the button hides itself again.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <LiveKitRoom>
 *   <StartAudio label="Click to allow audio playback" />
 * </LiveKitRoom>
 * ```
 *
 * @see Autoplay policy on MDN web docs: {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Best_practices#autoplay_policy}
